I am an Assistant Professor (Fixed-Term) in the Department of Political Science at Michigan State University.

My research focuses on climate change and intergroup dynamics in the Global South. My dissertation examines how climate change-induced economic hardship impacts social fabric and explores effective strategies for mitigating these negative effects in Sub-Saharan Africa, with Nigeria as my main research site. My broader research portfolio includes work on public attitudes toward climate-induced migration, building social cohesion in conflict-affected areas, and gender issues. Methodologically, I employ a diverse toolkit including statistical inference, geospatial analysis, surveys, experiments, and in-depth fieldwork interviews.

My work has received support from prestigious sources including the *NSF-APSA Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant* and the *UC Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation Dissertation Fellowship*. My research has been published in the *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences* and accepted at *Ecological Economics*.
