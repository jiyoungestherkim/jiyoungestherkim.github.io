I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the department of political science at the University of California Los Angeles.

My research focuses on climate change and intergroup dynamics in the Global South. My dissertation examines how climate change-induced economic hardship impacts social fabric and explores effective strategies for mitigating these negative effects in Sub-Saharan Africa, with Nigeria as my main research site. My broader research portfolio includes work on public attitudes toward climate-induced migration, building social cohesion in conflict-affected areas, and gender issues. Methodologically, I employ a diverse toolkit including statistical inference, geospatial analysis, surveys, experiments, and in-depth fieldwork interviews.

My work has received support from prestigious sources including the *NSF-APSA Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant* and the *UC Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation Dissertation Fellowship*. My research has been published in the *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences* and accepted at *Ecological Economics*.
